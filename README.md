## **Tech Stack**  

| Technology    | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| HTML5         | Structure the web pages, create input fields, buttons, nodes, and panels. |
| CSS3          | Style the HUD interface, animations, gradients, glowing effects, and responsive layout. |
| JavaScript    | Handle interactivity, node clicks, data display, localStorage navigation, and dynamic content. |
| LocalStorage  | Store user input (the topic) and pass it between landing and visualization pages. |
| html2canvas   | Capture the info panel and allow users to download it as a PNG image for offline reference. |
